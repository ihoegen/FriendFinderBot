## Inspiration
When I was in the 5th grade, we had we were assigned a pen pal who was another 5th grader from somewhere else in the country. Today, pen pals is almost a dead concept. What if we could revitalize it, while also reimagining a tool of today, in order to cultivate equity and access for everyone tomorrow. What I mean by this is, by having random people around the world with similar interests interact with each other, we can promote a community of equity and access. By establishing these connections, we can live through one another across the globe.

## What it does
At the moment, when you mention the bot on Twitter, it scans through your most recent tweets, and establishes a network of people with shared retweets. It then scans through those people's most recent tweets, and determines a connection between your most common keywords.

## How we built it

All of the underlying Twitter code is written in Golang, and the service runs on Google Cloud Engine

## Challenges we ran into

Our biggest challenge was coming up with an idea, but once we figured that out, we were all in agreement. Also, this is all of our first times using Golang. 

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

First Twitter bot for any of us, the user association algorithm is developed by us, and first time using Golang

## What I learned

How powerful Golang is as a language, and how surprisingly accurate our algorithm is at finding matches. 

## What's next for FriendFinderBot

We would love to expand into the Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit space.
